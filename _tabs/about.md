This technical blog is meant to be at the intersection of technology exploration, development, and security. With a passion for innovation and a penchant for secure systems, I've transformed my homelab into a dynamic playground where I experiment with cutting-edge solutions and craft robust architectures.

Driven by a desire to practice the theoretical knowledge I've learned thus far in my education, this blog serves to document some of my more complete projects to date, and is constantly evolving based on what I am currently learning. Rather than simply dumping all of my notes and ideas (like a Zettelkasten format), I thought I would use this platform to showcase my complete thought-processes and opinions on a subject matter.

> Any questions or opinions/suggestions are welcome! Please feel free to drop a comment in the individual article or email me at [blog@gabelcloud.com](mailto:blog@gabelcloud.com)
